## First basic recipe website project

### This project aims to build a basic recipe website using all the HTML syntaxes I have previously learnt.

At the completion of this project, I will have demonstrated the ability to:
- Use lists
- Use anchor elements
- Attached images locally or from the web
- Create headings and paragraphs
